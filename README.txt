DRUMGROWTH

A Puredata script that outputs weakly Markov-chain-generated drum patterns as MIDI files.

Requires Pd-extended, or Pd-vanilla with pdlua.

drumgrowth-main.pd_lua and MIDI.lua go into Puredata's /extras/ directory.

drumgrowth.pd goes wherever. Open this file to use the program.

Special thanks to Peter J. Billiam, creator of MIDI.lua.
